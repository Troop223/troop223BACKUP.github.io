<h1>Johnson's Crook</h1>

  <hr>

<strong>Johnson's Crook</strong> was a Fun Weekend Camping trip, with more than one adventure! It started off with us setting up camp, of course, then the next day going out all 
along the comp, repairing broken fire pits, (it was origanaly supposed to be a ~2 mile trip) but on our way back we ended up taking a wrong turn, and beliving we were on the right track,
started hiking aong the roadside for about 3 extra miles. By the time we had relized our mistake, we had reached the highway leading away. at that point, we made a call and were picked up, taking our haul back to 
camp. But wait, did i say haul? Yes i did! along the way we started picking up trash, And boy did we pick up a lot! by the time we were picked up, almost all of the scouts on the trek 
had full arms of trash we had picked up along the roadside, resulting in a entire pickup truck trunk being filled. Just another way our Troop, and Scouts in general, Proved ourselves
to be exceptional Citezens in the United States of America!
