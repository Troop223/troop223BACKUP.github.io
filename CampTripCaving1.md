<h1>05/18/24 Caving  Day Trip</h1>
<hr>

<p>
<strong>The</strong> Caving trip was pretty fun. We took a hour or two trip twords middle Tennessee to go to this HUGE cave that was about a mile hike from the highway.
As you approached the entrance, before you could even see the the opening, a wierd drop in temprature accured, and suddenly it was about ~50ish degrees. Once we actually got
down there, i was actually unprepaired for how cold it really was, so I barrowed a long sleeved shirt and prepaired for the worst,  but suprisingly it was not nearly as uncomftorable
as I thought it was going to be.

<p>After we got down there, it actually got quite nice. As we walked in through the entrance of the cave, we hugged the high left wall, and unbeknownst to us at the time, 
effectivley everything to our left and below us was slick and at least two inches of clay, which we would later find quite fun to get out of. So off we went, climbing over rocks
and exploring where we went. Now something i left out about this trip was that this was actually a planned trip, with a planned location and path that we were going to take.
But as it turns out, we actually took a Wrong turn at the beginning of the cave so we ended up exploring trying to find this alleged entrance to the cave, which we would not find
until much later. so for about two hours, we climbed around trying to find the right way, all the while getting to see some amazing formations. First off, there was the cave crickets
which we saw all throught the cave. Then there were the stalagmited,in addition to the staligtites, in addition to a large underground waterfall, only surpassed in size by ruby falls,
 also in Tennessee. We got to do a lot of the traditional caving things, like crawling on our bellies/knees as we pushed out packs ahead of us, as the celing was too low for us to get 
through with out packs on. we gou to walk past a large waterfall, see some truly amazing formations, and we also got to explore a TON throughout the cave. As we started back, because 
Could not find the entrance to this alleged cave, we picked up some little flags which we had left to mark our way. So finally we got back to the entrance, but two of our Scouts 
got the idea to go down a mud covered entrance to another cave, which was to our left as we looked in to the main cave entrance. So as most of our party watched, these two Scouts 
went off into this second entrance. And Lo and Behold, this would turn out to be the entrance we were supposed to go into at the begginning! so these two Scouts went in down there, 
the rest of the party waited at the front. But after a few minutes, one of our adult leaders decided to go down after them. so as we waited for what must have been 30-40 minuites,
they finally came back out. they said they had found the rope that helped them climb the hill, they found the cavern which was supposedly twenty stories tall, and saw the creek that 
flowed in there. so afterwards, we all changed, (because at that point we were all quite muddy) and went to El Meson to eat. Overall a very fun trip, but it left me tired at the end!
